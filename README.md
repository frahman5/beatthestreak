This project relies on data from the Lahman and Retrosheet baseball
data repositories to simulate different beat the streak strategies. 

MLB's beat the streak is a fantasy game that challenges users to 
correctly predict players who will get a hit 57 times in a row (with some
caveats). 

I built this simulation purely for personal use, and as such there may be
some bugs.
