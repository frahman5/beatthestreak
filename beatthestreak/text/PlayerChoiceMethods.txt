1) N globalSeasonBatAveP minPA serial-deterministic static 
    Parameters: simYear, batAveYear, N, P, minPA, doubleDown=True|False
      N: N accounts are created
      globalSeasonBatAveP minPA: P "globally" top players with respect to season 
         batting average in a given season are calculated at the start of 
         the simulation. Players only qualify if they have more plate 
         appearances than minPA
      serial deterministic: Each day, those P players are distributed to the 
         N accounts deterministically, by assigning all P players in order from 
         top batting average to lowest batting average to bots with lowest to 
         highest index, and repeating players if N is greater than P
      static: For the duration of the simulation, all bots either consisttently
         play singleDowns or doubleDonws

    Example: 
       Parameters: 2009, 2008, 20, 10, 500 (singleDown)

       20 accounts are created. the 10 players with top 2008 season batting
       averages and greater than or equal to 500 plate appearances are calculated. 
       On a given day, if e.g 7 (p1-p7) of the top 10 playres are active, 
       bots 1-20 are assigned players as follows"
          b1: p1   b6: p6   b11:p4   b16:p2
          b2: p2   b7: p7   b12:p5   b17:p3
          b3: p3   b8: p1   b13:p6   b18:p4
          b4: p4   b9: p2   b14:p7   b19:p5
          b5: p5   b10: p3  b15:p1   b20:p6

2) N P:globalSeasonBatAve-minPA Random Static
    Parameters: simYear, batAveYear, N, P, minPA, doubleDown=True|False
      N: N accounts are created
      globalSeasonBatAveP minPA: P "globally" top players with respect to season 
         batting average in a given season are calculated at the start of 
         the simulation. Players only qualify if they have more plate 
         appearances than minPA
      Random: Each day, those P players are distributed to the 
         N accounts randomly. 
      Static: Each day, all bots either do a singledown play or a doubledown play

       Example: See Above (method 1), except randomly distribute playres to bots

3) N P:(globalSeasonBatAve-minPA)&(perGameERA-minERA) serial-deterministic static
    Parameters: simYear, batAveYear, N, P, minPA, minERA, douleDown=True|False
        N: N accounts are created
        P:(globalSeasonBatAve-minPA)&(perGameERA-minERA): P "globally" top players
            with respect to season batting average in a given season are calculated at
            the start of the simulation. Players only qualify if they have more
            plate apperances than minPA. To be eligible to be picked by an account on 
            a given day, the opposing starting pitcher must have had an ERA ON THAT DAY
            that is higher than minERA.
       serial-deterministic: Each day, the players that qualify are distributed to the 
         N accounts deterministically, by assigning all players in order from 
         top batting average to lowest batting average to bots with lowest to 
         highest index, and repeating players if necessary. 
       Static: Each day, all bots either do a singledown play or a doubledown play

    Example:
        Parameters: 2010, 2009, 20, 10, 400, 3.0 (singleDown)

        20 accounts are created; the top 10 players with respect to 2009 season batting average
        that had more than 400 plate appearances are calculated and stored. On a given day, 
        if e.g 7 of the top 10 players are active and 4 of those 7 are facing pitchers with 
        in-season ERAs greater than 3.0, accounts 1-20 are assigned players as follows:
            b1: p1   b6: p2   b11:p3   b16:p4
            b2: p2   b7: p3   b12:p4   b17:p1
            b3: p3   b8: p4   b13:p1   b18:p2
            b4: p4   b9: p1   b14:p2   b19:p3
            b5: p1   b10: p2  b15:p3   b20:p4
4) N P:(globalSeasonBatAve-minPA)&(perGameERA-minERA) Random Static
     Parameters: simYear, batAveYear, N, P, minPA, minERA, doubleDown=True|False
        N: N accounts are created
        P:(globalSeasonBatAve-minPA)&(perGameERA-minERA): P "globally" top players
            with respect to season batting average in a given season are calculated at
            the start of the simulation. Players only qualify if they have more
            plate apperances than minPA. To be eligible to be picked by an account on 
            a given day, the opposing starting pitcher must have had an ERA ON THAT DAY
            that is higher than minERA.
        Random: Each day, qualifying playres are distributed to the N accounts randomly. 
        Static: Each day, all bots either do a singledown play or a doubledown play

    Example: See above (method 3), except randomly distribute playres to bots
