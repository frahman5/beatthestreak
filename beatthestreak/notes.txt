Notes:

1) How to extract all the retrosheet ids from a piece of text
	-open python
	
	>>> file = open('TEXT_FILE_NAME', "rw")
	>>> file_string_list = file.readlines()
	>>> file.close()
	>>> p = re.compile("[a-z]{5}[0-9]{3}")
	>>> matches = [p.findall(string) for string in file_string]
	>>> result = [participant for list in matches for participant in list]

	-copy and paste result into your desired code

2) Future refactorings
    -create progress bars
    	-> for calculation of batting averages
    	-> for progress of entire simulation
    - in testRetrosheet, change the below code to use the equivalent function
    from Data
    	r2013.get_gamelog_file_unzipped()
    - in retrosheet, take out all the file path handling functions and data
    that are native to retrosheet and put in the equivalent ones from Data
    -make each test in testSimulation be independent of each other
