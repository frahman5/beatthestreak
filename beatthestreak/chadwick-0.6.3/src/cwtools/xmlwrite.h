/*
 * This file defines a simple API for efficiently generating XML output,
 * with a very small overhead relative to simple printf()s.
 * Thie idea is to keep a linked list of open nodes.  Creating a child
 * node amounts to allocating a new node on the tail of the linked
 * list.
 *
 * Calling code does not have to worry about explicitly closing open nodes.
 * Creating a new sibling node of an existing node closes the previous
 * sibling, including any child nodes of that sibling.  Any remaining
 * open nodes are closed when the document is closed.
 *
 * Implementation notes:
 * - The linked list representing open nodes never deallocates closed
 *   node entries while building the tree, which avoids malloc()/free()
 *   overhead.
 * - Node names are stored as pointers to the original strings, so no
 *   allocation is done.  This means node names should not be changed in
 *   the calling code during the lifetime of the node.
 * - Pretty-printing is hardcoded to an indent of 2 spaces per level.
