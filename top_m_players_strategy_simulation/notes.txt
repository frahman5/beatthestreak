Notes:

1) How to extract all the retrosheet ids from a piece of text
	-open python
	
	>>> file = open('TEXT_FILE_NAME', "rw")
	>>> file_string_list = file.readlines()
	>>> file.close()
	>>> p = re.compile("[a-z]{5}[0-9]{3}")
	>>> matches = [p.findall(string) for string in file_string]
	>>> result = [participant for list in matches for participant in list]

	-copy and paste result into your desired code

2) Future refactorings
	- make a parent function called download_and_unzip. You never just used zipped files!
			-> then replace all individual calls to download and unzip with the daddy function
    - for any function that requires the event files or the gamelog files, have them
      check if they exist and then download and unzip if necessary
    - in gen_team_abbrevs, i dont think you actually need to rename the team file
    - player should fetch his own batting average, given the year for wich you want it
    		-> turn bat_ave and year inputs into bat_ave_year input, which tells Player
    		   from which year he should fetch his batting average
